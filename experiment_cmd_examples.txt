Experiment examples for Windows

(Assuming code is downloaded and installed in a working directory called "siminf_test".)

Set up a python conda environment with instructions in README.md

Open a Windows command window and activate the conda environment, and change directory to the working folder.

Set PYTHONPATH to the working directory. For example: 

	set PYTHONPATH=C:\Users\...\siminf_test
	
Run experiments. For example: 

	python siminf/individual_quantifiers/generate.py --setup experiment_setups/logical.json --max_quantifier_length 2 --model_size 2
